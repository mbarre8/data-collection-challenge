# data-collection-challenge

The following challenge I web scrapped and analyzed two different webpages. 

In part one of the challenge I used chrome devtools, splinter, beautifulsoup to parse through the data. I located the text elements and provide of list of article titles and their previews in a jupyter notebook. 

In part two of the challenge I used the same tools as part one to parse through the a webpage looking at mars temperature data. In addition, I used matplotlib and pandas to further aggregate the data on the webpage and plot graphs. I exported the graphs(as PNG images) for average low temperature by month, average low temperature by coldest to hottest months, the average pressure by month, and number of terrestrial days in a martin year using minimum temperature to a folder called data. Also, I exported the Dataframe(as a CSV file) to the same folder above.
